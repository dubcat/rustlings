          Is this your first time? Don't worry, Swiftlings is made for beginners!
          We are going to teach you a lot of things about Swift, but before we can
          get started, here are some notes about how Swiftlings operates:
          
          1. The central concept behind Swiftlings is that you solve exercises. These
             exercises usually contain some compiler or logic errors which cause the
             exercise to fail compilation or testing. It's your job to find all errors
             and fix them!
          2. Make sure to have your editor open in the 'swiftlings/' directory. Swiftlings
             will show you the path of the current exercise. Open the exercise file in
             your editor, fix errors and save the file.
          3. If you're stuck on an exercise, enter 'swiftlings hint <exercise_name>' to show a hint.
          4. If an exercise doesn't make sense to you, feel free to open an issue on GitHub!
        
        final_message: |
          We hope you enjoyed learning about the various aspects of Swift!
          If you noticed any issues, don't hesitate to report them on GitHub.
          You can also contribute your own exercises to help the greater community!
        
        exercises:
          - name: intro1
            dir: 00_intro
            test: false
            strict_warnings: false
            skip_check_unsolved: true
            hint: |
              This exercise is just to get you started!
              Run it with: swiftlings run intro1
          
          - name: variables1
            dir: 01_variables
            test: false
            strict_warnings: false
            hint: |
              The declaration is missing a keyword that is needed
              in Swift to create a new variable binding.
              In Swift, you use 'let' for constants and 'var' for variables.
          
          - name: variables2
            dir: 01_variables
            test: false
            strict_warnings: false
            hint: |
              The error message tells you that you cannot assign to a 'let' constant.
              In Swift, 'let' creates an immutable binding.
              What keyword do you use when you need to change a value?
          
          - name: functions1
            dir: 02_functions
            test: false
            strict_warnings: false
            hint: |
              A function is defined with the 'func' keyword.
              The basic syntax is: func functionName() { ... }
          
          - name: optionals1
            dir: 03_optionals
            test: false
            strict_warnings: false
            hint: |
              Optional values in Swift can be nil.
              You need to unwrap them before using them.
              Try using 'if let' to safely unwrap the optional.
